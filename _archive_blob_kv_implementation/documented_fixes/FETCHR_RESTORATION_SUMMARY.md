# Fetchr Landing Page Restoration

## Overview
Successfully restored the landing page to match the exact original applause-clone design with Fetchr branding, fixed dark theme, and all original content. The main app at `/app` retains its Mail DL branding and light/dark toggle.

## What Was Restored

### 1. Fixed Dark Theme ✅
Landing page now has a permanent dark theme:
- Background: `#0A0A0A` (very dark gray/black)
- Primary text: `#F7F7F7` (off-white)
- Muted text: `#A0A0A0` (gray)
- Accent color: `#2C64FF` (blue)
- No theme toggle on landing page

### 2. Fetchr Branding ✅
All components restored with original Fetchr branding:
- **LandingHeader**: "Fetchr" logo (not "Mail DL")
- **ScrollHighlightSection**: References "Fetchr" in content
- **LandingFooter**: "Fetchr" branding throughout
- GitHub links point to: `https://github.com/yayaq1/fetchr`

### 3. Original Content ✅

#### HeroSection
Restored original rotating words:
- Passwords
- Mindfulness
- Cybersecurity
- Glucose Tracking
- Blood Pressure
- Spam Call Blocking
- Group Texting
- Reading
- Menu Bars
- Meditation
- Consumer Software
- Mobile Apps

Title: **"Reinvent [rotating words]"**

#### ScrollHighlightSection
Kept original recruiter-focused narrative with "Fetchr" references and animated scroll effects.

#### LandingHeader
- Original navigation: Features, Pricing, Contact
- "Get Started" CTA → `/app`
- No theme toggle (landing is always dark)

#### LandingFooter
- "Fetchr" branding
- Original tagline: "Making recruitment effortless, one email at a time."
- yayaq1 attribution with link to GitHub
- Social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Copyright: "© 2025 Fetchr. All rights reserved."

#### CTA Section
Original text and buttons:
- "Ready to save hours every week?"
- "Try It Free" → `/app`
- "View on GitHub" → `https://github.com/yayaq1/fetchr`

### 4. Navigation Flow ✅
1. User visits `/` (Fetchr landing page - always dark)
2. Sees "Reinvent [rotating words]" hero
3. Scrolls through animated content section
4. Clicks "Try It Free" or "Get Started"
5. Redirects to `/app` (Mail DL with theme toggle)
