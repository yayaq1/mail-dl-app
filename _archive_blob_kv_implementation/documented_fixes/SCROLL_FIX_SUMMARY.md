# ScrollHighlightSection Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Initial Scroll Space ✅
**Problem**: No initial scroll space before text animation begins
**Fix**: Added `pt-20` class to the main tag in `/app/page.tsx`
```jsx
<main className="pt-20">
```

### 2. Lenis-GSAP Integration ✅
**Problem**: Lenis smooth scroll wasn't properly integrated with GSAP ScrollTrigger
**Fix**: Updated `/components/SmoothScroll.tsx` to:
- Import GSAP and ScrollTrigger
- Add `lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update)` to sync Lenis with ScrollTrigger
- Use GSAP ticker for animation frame updates
- Properly cleanup on unmount

### 3. "Recruiters" Word Not Highlighting ✅
**Problem**: Highlight words weren't being split into characters, so they couldn't animate
**Fix**: Updated `renderWord` function in `/components/ScrollHighlightSection.tsx` to split highlight words into characters:
```jsx
if (isHighlight) {
  return (
    <span className="highlight-word whitespace-nowrap" style={{ opacity: 0.25 }}>
      {splitText(word)}  // Now splits into characters
    </span>
  );
}
```

### 4. Fixed Accent Color ✅
**Problem**: Using theme variable `decoration-accent` instead of fixed color
**Fix**: Changed to fixed blue color `decoration-[#2C64FF]` for underlines

## Changes Made

1. **`/app/page.tsx`**
   - Added `pt-20` to main tag

2. **`/components/SmoothScroll.tsx`**
   - Added GSAP ScrollTrigger integration
   - Added Lenis scroll event listener
   - Updated RAF to use GSAP ticker

3. **`/components/ScrollHighlightSection.tsx`**
   - Fixed `renderWord` to split highlight words into characters
   - Changed decoration color to fixed blue

## How It Should Work Now

1. **Initial scroll**: Small scroll space (80px from `pt-20`) before animation starts
2. **Text pinning**: Text stays centered while scrolling through 500vh
3. **Character animation**: Each character fades in with stagger effect
4. **Highlight words**: "Recruiters", "resume", etc. get underlined when reached
5. **Smooth scrolling**: Lenis provides smooth momentum scrolling synced with GSAP

## Testing

Visit http://localhost:3001 to see:
- Landing page with fixed dark theme
- Scroll down to see the text animation
- "Recruiters" and other highlight words should animate and underline
- Smooth scrolling throughout

## Comparison

- **Original (localhost:3002)**: applause-clone with working animation
- **Fixed (localhost:3001)**: mail-dl-app with restored animation

## Key Differences from Original

The implementation is now nearly identical to the original, with:
- Same scroll height (500vh)
- Same pinning behavior
- Same character opacity animation
- Same highlight word underlining
- Proper Lenis-GSAP integration
